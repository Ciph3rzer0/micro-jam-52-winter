Constantly falling behind
Tired
No down time

# GameIdeas

Taxi/Delivery driver (Simpsons Road Rage, Taxi) on ice and snow.
	- Switch between show plow and taxi cab. (multiple jobs, overworked)
	- Jobs:
		- Plow Snow and clear ice
		- Pick up trash
		- Cut down trees?
		- Transport people and pizzas.
	- Mechanics
		- Limited gear at one time, requires switching tools or vehicles.

Sokoban on ice and snow.  Packing facility.
	- Puzzle game trying to pack objects into a box for delivery.
	- Boxes slide on ice till they hit a wall
	- Snow banks can be shoveled
	- Maybe snow accumulates over time, changing the field.
	- Urgency: more boxes keep dropping into the field and you have to keep packing to stay ahead
		(Very loosely, like Tetris)
	
Ice Baneling
	- Get from point a to point b on ice.
	- Slip sliding physics could be fun.
	- Maybe lemmings type mechanic where you need to construct/clear a path to get a bunch of 'banelings' through.

Traffic Control
	- Like "pipedream" game or luminosity "Train of Thought".
	- People spawn on a path and walk/drive to their destination
	- there is ice and snow blocking them.  You have to clear the path or reroute them so they make it to their destination on time and unharmed.
	- Spend resources to clear paths, specific shapes, like a straight line more efficient.

Cozy cafe
	- but you actually do all the jobs but have to maintain the cozy vibe in front of the customers (part overcooked, part stealth game)
	- Serve hot coco, snowcones, etc.

Maria's ideas:

Burnout
 - It's a snowman trying to throw logs into a campfire to keep to keep him a lost child/pet warm
 - (Idk how it's "overworked")
 - Interesting idea of having to keep something cold and another think hot at the same time.

Iditarod race
	- overworked doggies pulling sleds husky or siberian huskies

Pizza Delivery
	- Deliver pizzas on foot in a small village in a blizzard
	- Each delivery has a guaranteed window to rush you
	- Similar to Taxi driver above, but on foot and keeping warm is an integral mechanic.
	- Find time to build inner warmth while still treking through the storm to deliver on time.
	- Figure out how to maximize your time, maybe you can craft something while you're warming up
	- Steal someone's hand warmers from their garage.
	- IDK,
